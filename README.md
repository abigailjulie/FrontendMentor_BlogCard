## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to pay close attention to detail. The margins and the padding make a lot of difference in this image.

### Continued development

The use of the box-shadow really allows this image to pop. In the future I would like to implement smaller details like this to help the UI.
